## 1. Acceptance of Terms
By accessing or using Noeji, you confirm that you are at least **18 years of age** and have the legal capacity to enter into these Terms. If you are accessing or using the Service on behalf of an entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that entity to these Terms, and you still affirm you are 18 years of age or older. **The Service is not intended for and should not be used by individuals under the age of 18.**

## 2. License to Use the Service
### Scope of License
The Service is licensed, not sold, to you. Subject to your compliance with these Terms, RokaByte grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to download, install, and use the Service for your personal, non-commercial use on any compatible device that you own or control.
### License Restrictions
Except as expressly permitted in these Terms, you may not: (i) distribute or make the Service available over a network where it could be used by multiple devices at the same time; (ii) transfer, redistribute or sublicense the Service; (iii) copy, reverse-engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, modify, or create derivative works of the Service, any updates, or any part thereof (except as and only to the extent that any foregoing restriction is prohibited by applicable law). If you sell a device on which the Service is installed, you must remove the Service from the device before doing so. RokaByte reserves all rights in and to the Service not expressly granted to you under these Terms.

## 3. Service Description
Noeji is an AI/LLM-powered platform (the "Service") designed to assist users with capturing, organizing, processing, and developing their ideas and information. The specific features, tools, and functionalities offered through the Service are dynamic and may be modified, added to, or removed at RokaByte's sole discretion as the Service evolves. The Service utilizes artificial intelligence and relies on third-party AI models and cloud infrastructure to deliver its functionalities, as further detailed in Section 7 (Artificial Intelligence Features).

## 4. Account Registration and Security
### Account Creation
To use most features of Noeji, you must register for an account using Google Sign-In or Apple Sign-In. You agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information during the registration process.
### Account Responsibility
You are responsible for safeguarding your account credentials, including any passcode you set for locking ideabooks. You agree to maintain the security of your account by protecting your password and restricting access to your account and your devices. You are solely responsible for all activities that occur under your account, whether or not you have authorized such activities. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account.
### Passcode
Noeji allows you to set a passcode to lock ideabooks. This passcode is not stored by Noeji in a recoverable format. An encrypted fingerprint of the passcode is stored to allow verification across multiple devices. **YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR REMEMBERING YOUR PASSCODE. ROKABYTE CANNOT RETRIEVE OR RESET YOUR PASSCODE IF YOU FORGET IT. LOSS OF YOUR PASSCODE MAY RESULT IN PERMANENT LOSS OF ACCESS TO YOUR LOCKED IDEABOOKS.**

## 5. User Tiers and Subscriptions
Noeji offers different tiers of service:
- **Free Tier:** Access to basic features with usage limitations as described within the Service.
- **Pro Tier (Subscription):** Access to enhanced features and higher usage limits. Pro Tier requires a paid subscription, available on a monthly or annual basis.
    - **Billing:** Subscription fees are billed in advance on a recurring basis through the Apple App Store or Google Play Store, managed via RevenueCat. You authorize the respective app store to charge your selected payment method.
    - **Auto-Renewal:** Your Pro subscription will automatically renew at the end of each billing cycle unless you cancel it through your app store account settings before the renewal date.
    - **Price Changes:** RokaByte reserves the right to change subscription fees. We will provide you with at least thirty (30) days' advance notice of any fee changes. Your continued use of the Pro Tier after a fee change constitutes your agreement to the new fee.
    - **Cancellations:** You may cancel your Pro subscription at any time. Cancellations will take effect at the end of your current billing period. You will retain Pro access until then.
    - **No Refunds:** Subscription fees are non-refundable, except as required by applicable law or as determined by Apple or Google's refund policies. No refunds or credits will be provided for partial subscription periods, unused service, or if your account is terminated due to a violation of these Terms. This no-refund policy applies to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.
    - **Promotions:** We may offer promotional discounts. Any specific terms related to promotions will be disclosed at the time of the offer.

## 6. User Content and Intellectual Property
### Your Content
You retain ownership of the ideas, text, voice recordings, and other content you create, input, or upload to Noeji ("User Content").
#### User Warranties:
You represent and warrant that:
a. You own or have all necessary licenses, rights, consents, and permissions to submit your User Content and to grant the rights granted herein;
b. Your User Content, and RokaByte's use of such User Content as contemplated by these Terms, will not infringe, misappropriate, or violate any third party's intellectual property rights, or rights of publicity or privacy, or result in the violation of any applicable law or regulation; and
c. Your User Content complies with these Terms and all applicable laws.

### License to RokaByte for User Content
By using Noeji, you grant RokaByte a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable, and transferable license to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display, and perform your User Content solely for the purposes of operating, providing, improving, and developing the Service. This includes using your User Content to enable the functionalities of the Service, which involves sending it to and processing by third-party AI service providers. RokaByte itself does not use your identifiable User Content to train its own proprietary AI models (if any). The use of your User Content by such third-party AI providers, including for their own purposes like model training, is governed entirely by their respective terms and privacy policies, which may change over time and are not controlled by RokaByte. We encourage you to review the terms and policies of these providers, which are further detailed in Section 7 and in our Privacy Policy. Aggregated and anonymized User Content may be used by RokaByte for analytical purposes and to improve the Service, subject to our Privacy Policy.

### AI-Generated Content
Content generated by the Service's artificial intelligence features based on your User Content or prompts is referred to as "AI-Generated Content." Specific terms regarding AI-Generated Content are detailed in Section 7 (Artificial Intelligence Features).

### RokaByte's Intellectual Property
The Service, including its "look and feel" (e.g., text, graphics, images, logos), proprietary content, software, AI models (to the extent owned by or licensed to us directly, distinct from third-party provider models), and all intellectual property rights therein, are and will remain the exclusive property of RokaByte LLC and its licensors. You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of our Service or included software. You agree not to remove, alter, or obscure any copyright, trademark, service mark, or other proprietary rights notices incorporated in or accompanying the Service.

### Feedback
If you provide us with any feedback, suggestions, or ideas regarding the Service ("Feedback"), you grant RokaByte an unrestricted, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, fully-paid, royalty-free right to use the Feedback in any manner and for any purpose, including to improve the Service and create other products and services.

## 7. Artificial Intelligence Features
The Service incorporates artificial intelligence ("AI") and large language model ("LLM") technologies, often from third-party providers, to offer various features. You acknowledge and agree to the following:
- **Nature of AI:** AI and LLM technologies are experimental and constantly evolving. The performance, capabilities, accuracy, and limitations of AI features within the Service may change over time, sometimes without notice.
- **AI-Generated Content:**
    - **License:** Subject to your compliance with these Terms, RokaByte grants you a license to use the AI-Generated Content created for you through the Service for your personal or internal business purposes.
    - **No Exclusivity:** AI-Generated Content may be similar or identical to content generated for other users, and you do not obtain exclusive rights to such content.
    - **Accuracy and Reliability:** AI-Generated Content may contain inaccuracies, errors, biases, or inconsistencies and may produce unexpected or offensive outputs. It is provided for informational and creative purposes only. ROKABYTE MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES ABOUT THE ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, COMPLETENESS, TIMELINESS, OR SUITABILITY OF ANY AI-GENERATED CONTENT.
    - **User Responsibility:** You are solely responsible for evaluating, validating, and verifying any AI-Generated Content before relying on or using it. You should not rely on AI-Generated Content for critical decisions, or for professional, legal, medical, financial, or other specialized guidance without independent verification.
    - **No Liability:** RokaByte disclaims all liability for any actions you take or decisions you make based on AI-Generated Content. Your use of AI-Generated Content is at your own risk.
    - **Disclosure:** If you choose to publish or share AI-Generated Content outside of the Service, we encourage you to disclose its AI-assisted origin where appropriate and in accordance with responsible AI practices.
- **Third-Party AI Providers and Their Terms:**
    - To provide certain AI-powered features, Noeji sends relevant User Content to, and processes it through, third-party AI service providers. Your use of these AI features means you are also subject to the terms and conditions of these providers.
    - Currently, our key third-party AI provider for such features is Google, and we utilize their Google Gemini API. Their terms of service can be found at: [https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/terms](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/terms) (or any successor URL Google may provide).
    - **Data Handling by Third Parties:** The data handling practices of Google (including for AI model training) are governed by their terms and privacy policies, not RokaByte's. As detailed in our Privacy Policy, Google's terms for this specific paid service (as of our last review) state that your content is not used to improve their general AI models.
    - **Terms Subject to Change and Your Responsibility:** These third-party terms are subject to change by Google at any time, and RokaByte does not control and is not responsible for the practices or terms of Google or any other third-party AI provider. We encourage you to review their terms and policies directly and regularly.
    - **Future Providers:** If we integrate other key third-party AI providers for core functionalities in the future, we will endeavor to update this section or direct you to our Privacy Policy for such information.

## 8. Acceptable Use and Prohibited Conduct
You agree not to:
- Use the Service for any illegal or unauthorized purpose, or in violation of any applicable laws (including but not limited to copyright, privacy, and export control laws).
- Input, upload, generate, or share any User Content that is unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, libelous, invasive of another's privacy, hateful, or racially, ethnically, or otherwise objectionable.

- Attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Service, other users' accounts, or our computer systems or networks.
- Transmit any worms, viruses, trojan horses, malware, or any code of a destructive or disruptive nature.
- Attempt to circumvent any usage limits, security measures, or access restrictions of the Service.

- Use the Service to generate spam, unsolicited messages, or content that promotes harmful activities or disinformation.

## 9. Third-Party Services and Content (Non-AI)
Beyond the AI providers covered in Section 7 and detailed in our Privacy Policy, Noeji may integrate with or rely on other third-party services, including but not limited to:
- Cloud hosting and database services (e.g., Firebase).
- Authentication services (Google Sign-In, Apple Sign-In).
- Subscription management (RevenueCat).

Your use of these third-party services is at your own risk and may be subject to their respective terms and privacy policies. RokaByte is not responsible for the practices, content, or availability of these third-party services.

## 10. Service Availability and Maintenance
RokaByte will use reasonable efforts to keep the Service operational. However, you acknowledge and agree that the Service may be subject to temporary interruptions or periods of unavailability due to maintenance (whether scheduled or emergency), repairs, updates, upgrades, network or equipment failures, or other causes beyond or within our reasonable control.
We reserve the right to suspend, discontinue, modify, or limit access to the Service or any part of it, with or without notice, at any time and for any reason, including but not limited to, for conducting maintenance, implementing updates or upgrades, addressing security concerns, or improving the Service. You agree that RokaByte will not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension, discontinuance, or limitation of the Service, or any loss of data or User Content resulting therefrom, except as may be expressly agreed by RokaByte in writing or as strictly required by applicable law.
Generally, no refunds or credits will be offered for any Service interruptions, downtime, or unavailability, including those resulting from maintenance, technical issues, or Service modifications. This applies whether such interruptions are scheduled or unscheduled, and regardless of their duration, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, for paying Pro Tier subscribers, in the event of a significant, prolonged, and material paid-service interruption that is directly and solely attributable to RokaByte's fault (and not due to factors outside our reasonable control, your actions, or third-party service failures impacting the broader internet or our essential suppliers), RokaByte may, at its sole discretion, consider providing a pro-rata credit or refund for the unused portion of the affected subscription period. Any such consideration will be determined on a case-by-case basis. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to limit any mandatory refund rights you may have under applicable consumer protection laws or the policies of the app store through which you subscribed (e.g., Apple App Store, Google Play Store), which will take precedence if they provide greater rights.

## 11. Abuse Detection and Service Discontinuation
RokaByte monitors for abuse of the Service. We reserve the right to investigate suspected violations of these Terms. We may suspend or terminate your access to the Service immediately, without prior notice or liability, if we determine, in our sole discretion, that you have violated these Terms, abused the Service, or engaged in any conduct that we deem harmful to the Service, other users, or our interests.

## 12. Account Deactivation and Data Deletion
### Inactive Accounts
RokaByte reserves the right to deactivate and delete accounts that have been inactive for a continuous period of twelve (12) months. An account is deemed inactive if you have not logged in during that period. We will attempt to notify you via your registered email address at least thirty (30) days before deleting an inactive account.
### Termination by You
You may terminate your account at any time by contacting us as specified in the "Contact Us" section or, if available, through account settings.
### Effect of Termination
Upon termination, your right to use the Service and all licenses granted to you by RokaByte hereunder will immediately cease. Except as may be required by applicable law or as expressly stated in our Privacy Policy, RokaByte will have no obligation to maintain or provide you with access to your User Content or other account data after termination, and we may delete your User Content and other account data in accordance with our Privacy Policy and data retention practices. RokaByte is not responsible for any loss of data resulting from account termination.
### Survival
Provisions of these Terms that by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.

## 13. Disclaimers of Warranties
THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS, WITH ALL FAULTS AND WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ACCURACY, QUIET ENJOYMENT, NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE.

YOU AGREE NOT TO USE THE SERVICE FOR OR IN CONNECTION WITH ANY HIGH-RISK ACTIVITIES.

## 14. Limitation of Liability
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL ROKABYTE LLC, ITS AFFILIATES, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS, OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, DATA, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES (EVEN IF ROKABYTE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES), RESULTING FROM:

A. YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICE;
B. ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON THE SERVICE, INCLUDING AI-GENERATED CONTENT;
C. ANY USER CONTENT OBTAINED FROM THE SERVICE;
D. UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE, OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR USER CONTENT; OR

IN NO EVENT SHALL ROKABYTE'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SERVICE EXCEED THE GREATER OF (I) ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS ($100.00) OR (II) THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU TO ROKABYTE FOR USE OF THE PRO TIER OF THE SERVICE IN THE SIX (6) MONTHS PRIOR TO THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE LIABILITY.

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. ACCORDINGLY, SOME OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

## 15. Indemnification
You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless RokaByte LLC and its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, and agents from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney's fees) arising from: (a) your use of and access to the Service; (b) your violation of any term of these Terms; (c) your violation of any third-party right, including without limitation any copyright, property, or privacy right; (d) any claim that your User Content caused damage to a third party or infringed any third party's intellectual property rights; or (e) your use of AI-Generated Content in violation of these Terms or applicable law. This defense and indemnification obligation will survive these Terms and your use of the Service.

## 16. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution
These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, United States, without regard to its conflict of law principles.

Any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, or validity thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, shall be determined by arbitration in San Jose, California, before one arbitrator. The arbitration shall be administered by JAMS pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures. Judgment on the Award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This clause shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.

**YOU AND ROKABYTE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.**

You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Service or these Terms must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.

## 17. U.S. Government Restricted Rights
If you are a U.S. government entity, our Service is provided with "RESTRICTED RIGHTS."

## 19. Changes to Terms
RokaByte reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If we make changes we determine to be material, we will endeavor to notify you before such changes become effective. Notification methods may include updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of these Terms, providing notice through the Service (such as a pop-up or announcement), or, where we deem it appropriate for significant changes or if required by applicable law, by sending a notification to your registered email address. The timing and method of notice will be at our reasonable discretion, taking into account the nature of the changes and applicable legal requirements. It is your responsibility to review these Terms periodically for changes. By continuing to access or use our Service after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms.
